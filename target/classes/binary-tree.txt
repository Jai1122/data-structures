Main applications of trees include

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/binary-tree-set-2-properties/
1) The maximum number of nodes at level ‘l’ of a binary tree is 2^l.
2)  a)  If height of a tree with a single node is considered as 1 then,
        the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^h) – 1
    b)  If height of a tree with a single node is considered as 0 then,
         the maximum number of nodes in a binary tree of height ‘h’ is (2^(h+1)) – 1
3) In a Binary Tree with N nodes, minimum possible height or the minimum number of levels is
        (|log(N+1)|)      -> if height of tree with one node is considered to be 1
        (|log(N+1)| -1)   -> if height of tree with one node is considered to be 0

4) A Binary Tree with L leaves has at least (|LogL|+ 1) levels
5) In Binary tree where every node has 0 or 2 children,
    the number of leaf nodes is always one more than nodes with two children.

Types of Binary Tree
6) Full Binary Tree     - A Binary Tree is a full binary tree if every node has 0 or 2 children.
7) Complete Binary Tree - A Binary Tree is a Complete Binary Tree if all the levels are completely filled except
                            possibly the last level and the last level has all keys as left as possible.
8) Perfect Binary Tree  - A Binary tree is a Perfect Binary Tree in which all the internal nodes have
                            two children and all leaf nodes are at the same level.
                            In a Perfect Binary Tree,  number of leaf nodes is the number of internal nodes plus 1
9) Balanced Binary Tree - A binary tree is balanced if the height of the tree is O(Log n)
                            where n is the number of nodes.
                           Balanced BST are performance-wise good as they provide O(log n) time for search, insert and delete.
    a)  AVL tree maintains O(Log n) height by making sure that the difference between the heights of the left
        and right subtrees is atmost 1.
    b)  Red-Black trees maintain O(Log n) height by making sure that the number of Black nodes on every root to
        leaf paths is the same and there are no adjacent red nodes.
10) Degenerate (or pathological) tree - A Tree where every internal node has one child.
                                        Such trees are performance-wise same as linked list.

11) A Tree is typically traversed in two ways: O(n) time
    a) Breadth First Traversal (Or Level Order Traversal) - Root Node is traversed first.
                     Extra space depends on width of tree. More balanced tree has more width hence more space needed
    b) Depth First Traversals - Leaf nodes are visited first and Extra space depends on height of tree.
            - Inorder Traversal (Left-Root-Right)
            - Preorder Traversal (Root-Left-Right)
            - Postorder Traversal (Left-Right-Root)
12) A tree is a Continuous tree if in each root to leaf path, the absolute difference between keys of
            two adjacent is 1. We are given a binary tree, we need to check if the tree is continuous or not.
13) It is not possible to construct a general Binary Tree from preorder and postorder traversals
14) https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/if-you-are-given-two-traversal-sequences-can-you-construct-the-binary-tree/
    Following combination can uniquely identify a tree.
        a)  Inorder and Preorder.
        b)  Inorder and Postorder.
        c)  Inorder and Level-order.
     And following do not.
        a)  Postorder and Preorder.
        b)  Preorder and Level-order.
        c)  Postorder and Level-order.
        d)  Preorder, Post order and Level order
15) The reverse of the Preorder traversal of mirror tree will be the Postorder traversal of original tree
16) Height == max depth of tree
17) The diameter of a tree T is the largest of the following quantities:
        the diameter of T’s left subtree.
        the diameter of T’s right subtree.
        the longest path between leaves that goes through the root of T (this can be computed from the heights of the subtrees of T)
