* The depth of a node is the number of edges present in path from the root node of a tree to that node. Root is at depth 0. Related to level.
* The height of a node is the number of edges present in the longest path connecting that node to a leaf node. Leaf is at height 0
* Depth of root == Height of leaf
* The diameter (or width) of a tree is the number of nodes on the longest path between any two leaf nodes.
* To construct BST from preorder array, iterate through the array and create nodes.
