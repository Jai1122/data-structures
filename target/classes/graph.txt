1) Detecting cycle in a graph
A graph has cycle if and only if we see a back edge during DFS. So we can run DFS for the graph and check for back edges
2) A mother vertex in a graph G = (V,E) is a vertex v such that all other vertices in G can be reached by a path from v.
3) A directed graph is strongly connected if there is a path between all pairs of vertices.
    A strongly connected component (SCC) of a directed graph is a maximal strongly connected subgraph
    We can find all strongly connected components in O(V+E) time using Kosaraju’s algorithm
4) The reach-ability matrix is called transitive closure of a graph
